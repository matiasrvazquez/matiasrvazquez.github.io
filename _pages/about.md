I am Matias R. Vazquez, Senior Data Scientist at [PhysicsX](https://www.physicsx.ai/), where we have a ton of fun building AI systems for advanced engineering applications. I believe that the combination of scientific rigour, creativity and agile ways of working can deeply transform and accelerate the way we design an operate our most complex systems.

I am interested in all aspects of Machine Learning (ML) - from the abstract mathematical ideas to the MLOps practices that turn them into products and tangible deliverables. I have a track record of ML projects in various  industries - some of my favorites have been: mathematical optimisation for Operations Research, Monte Carlo simulations for logistics, and the use of Graph Neural Networks for modelling physical systems

I am (and always will be) a physicist. Before entering the AI industry, I did academic research in particle physics at the University of Paris-Saclay, where I obtained my PhD. I studied the phenomenology of Higgs Bosons at CERN's particle collider @ Geneva. I am also interested in quantum computing and information. You can find a list of my scientific publications in [Google Scholar](asahttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9fba9FMAAAAJs).

In my free time I enjoy reading, surfing, traveling and trying new sports.
