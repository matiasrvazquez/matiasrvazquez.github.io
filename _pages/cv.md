## üìå On The Side

**Motorbike Touring** @ Americas _(Nov 2017 - Sep 2019)_ <br>

I did a 22 months motorbike solo tour around South, Central and North America as a full-time traveler. I drove 35000 km, visited 17 countries, and met **a lot** of wonderful people. Some interesting aspects of this experience:
  - Kept up a travel blog (in Spanish), [see here](https://lavidaquedanlasvueltas.wordpress.com/). 
  - Broadcasted adventures and interesting historical facts of the places I visited via instagram with +2k followers. [Check it here](https://instagram.com/lavidaquedanlasvueltas) (in Spanish).
  - I learnt the art of motorcycle maintenance. And some Zen.

**Barista, waiter and private tutor** @ London, UK _(Oct 2013 - Sep 2014)_ <br>

After my undergraduate studies I took an academic gap year. During this period I had a number of jobs, including: barista, waiter, kitchen porter and private math tutor.
